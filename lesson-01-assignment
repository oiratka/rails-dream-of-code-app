#1. Find course record for the Spring 2025 Intro to Programming
intro = CodingClass.find_by({ title: 'Intro to Programming' }) #maps to DB table coding_classes; find_by - finder method
# { title: 'Intro to Programming' } - A Ruby hash is a collection of key, value pairs
spring_2025 = Trimester.find_by(year: 2025, term: 'Spring') # year: 2025 changed from string

#2. We can get the LIST OF COURSE records for that trimester by using a finder method on Course model
#We r looking for courses where trimester is Fall 2025 or where trimester id is the id we had identifies
fall_2025 = Trimester.find_by(year: 2025, term: 'Fall')
upcoming_courses = Course.where(trimester_id: fall_2025.id) #uncommented and replaced with object

#3 Now, we need to get the list of course names for these courses
#CodingClass.find_by(id: 1)

#OR with fewer steps
upcoming_courses.each do |course|
    puts course.coding_class.title
end

#Need a list of emails for students in the current intro course

course = Course.find_by(coding_class: intro, trimester: spring_2025)
enrollments = Enrollment.where(course: course) #replaced course_id: course as per reviewer's comments for simplification
students  = enrollments.first(2).map(&:student)
students.each do |student|
    puts "Student: #{student.first_name} #{student.last_name}"
    puts "Email: #{student.email}"
    puts "---"
end

#TASK 2 to email all the mentors for students in the current (Spring 2025)
# Intro to Programming course who do not yet have a final grade

#first find students with no grades which is in enrollment table
not_graded = Enrollment.where(course: course, final_grade: nil)
#then connect enrollment id with mentor id in mentorenrollments table
mentor_enrollments = MentorEnrollmentAssignment.where(enrollment_id: not_graded.select(:id))
mentors_id = mentor_enrollments.pluck(:mentor_id).uniq
mentors_to_email = Mentor.where(id: mentors_id) #defined mentors_to_email
mentors_to_email.first(2).each do |mentor|
    puts "Mentor: #{mentor.id}"
    puts "Email: #{mentor.email}"
    puts "---"
